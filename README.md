# Debt Simplifier

Its a web application to do Debt-simplification in a group of people.

Debt-simplification is a feature that restructures debt within groups of people. 
It does not change the total amount that anyone owes, 
but it makes it easier to pay people back by minimizing the total number of payments.

For example: 

Say, Shwet, Devvrat, and Rohan share an apartment. 
Shwet owes Devvrat Rs.20, and Devvrat owes Rohan Rs.20. Rather than making two separate payments, 
Splitwise would tell Shwet to pay Rs.20 to Rohan directly, thereby minimizing the total number of payments being made. 
This ensures that people are paid back more quickly and efficiently.
